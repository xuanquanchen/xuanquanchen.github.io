## 🏗 Project Experience

### Individual Projects
- **LinkNet34_SPP** (Baltimore, MD, USA; Nov 2024 – Dec 2024)  
  Integrated an SPP module into LinkNet34, boosting the Dice coefficient by 1.97% on the EndoVis 2017 dataset.

- **CupAxis3D** (Baltimore, MD, USA; Nov 2024 – Dec 2024)  
  Reconstructed dense tabletop scenes from RGB‑D frames into point clouds with Open3D; fused via pairwise registration and voxel averaging. Performed ROI segmentation and downsampling, generated axis hypotheses using random slicing and ellipse fitting, then selected inliers via clustering.

### Team Project
- **Sync Trip** (Baltimore, MD, USA; Mar 2025 – May 2025)  
  - Implemented multi‑user real‑time itinerary synchronization using Firebase with local caching.
