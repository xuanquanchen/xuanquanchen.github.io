## ⚽️ Personal Interests

- ⚽️ I'm an amateur football (soccer) player, mainly playing as a right wing back—but dreaming of defensive midfielder.

My favorite players include [Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi), [Kevin De Bruyne](https://www.mancity.com/players/kevin-de-bruyne), [Rodri](https://www.mancity.com/players/rodrigo), and [Yui Hasegawa](https://www.mancity.com/players/yui-hasegawa).
- 📷 A part-time photographer who mainly shoots landscapes—I also love hiking and camping. (Check out my photos [here](#))
- 🎼 I played tuba in my university's orchestra during my undergraduate years, winning regional awards with the team.
- 📚 I’m passionate about language learning, currently wrestling with Japanese😢 and planning to learn French. I love reading as well (especially philosophy and psychology).
